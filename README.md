### Hi there 
My name is Zeeshawn Marshall and I'm a Software Engineer! I'm from Los Angeles, California.
I currently work at Career Karma as a SE Career Coach. However through my last role at 
http://pyrodrone.com and my intensive training at <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com/los-angeles/coding-bootcamp/qa/l?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=la_branding_softdev&utm_term=cd_ex&utm_content=603744898025&gclid=Cj0KCQjwn4qWBhCvARIsAFNAMih4SGu8ueiWn3gISwC1Mew_QQZtBIO6Gsw2zr2SLKzv7U_vO9I_XCIaAo83EALw_wcB" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a>, Plus years of freelance work
I have gained the experience to become a proficient problem solver who knows what works
and what doesn't.
